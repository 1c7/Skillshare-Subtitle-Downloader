It is never too late to post a project in the project section\u00a0of this course!\u00a0I hope you are enjoying this course! Do\u00a0not feel you have to finish the entire course to start work on your first student project. You were tasked in the start of the Logo Design Process section of the course with a client brief and logo design project.\nYou can watch the client brief video\u00a0in the course in the Logo Design Process Section for the Coffee guild to give you a nice visual overview of this client project. Also, make sure you check out in the downloadable files area, a file called \"Coffee Grind Client Brief\" pdf\u00a0will detail everything you need to know. I made this as detailed and realistic as possible based on hundreds of projects I completed as a graphic designer. \u00a0I would love to see your brainstorming process, messy or not! Your sketches, ideas and inspirations too. Feel free to post as a little or as much as you like for your project. \u00a0There is also a second student project in the Golden Ratio portion of the course if you are interested in that client brief\u00a0instead. You can decide to post a project for the pacific calm logo challenge too OR you can try creating a golden ratio logo, symbol or icon using what we learned in the course. \u00a0This is free and open ended, I just want to see you work through the logo design process. Feel free to do just one of these projects talked about above or all of them!\u00a0The downloadable resources are available as single file downloads (in the right side of this project section) but also as one larger zip file for those who want to have them all downloaded at the same time. \u00a0\n\n\u00a0",
