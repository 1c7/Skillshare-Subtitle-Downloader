00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.490
All right,

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.460
So let's say we've heard back to the client.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.320
They loved him all,

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.820
but they wanted to see a little bit of color added.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:13.150
Of course,

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.180
we haven't added the color,

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.920
so they wanted us to explore color.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.480
And they also wanted us to do a little bit of a gritty texture on some of these to see how

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.030
that looks.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.810
They kind of wanted that greediness and they love texture.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.260
They wanted to kind of have something that was a little more gritty and nature,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.090
and these are all very clean.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.070
So they love the overall look of these.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.490
They just wanted to add that element so we could do that.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.640
I have a lesson in the first section.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.830
If you've already seen that as adding grunge texture by using a layering mass,

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:46.150
we're gonna do that right now I have that free resource a link to that that you can

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.140
download these kind of textures that we're gonna be using their just basically J peg

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.260
textures that we're gonna overlay on top of these.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.830
Of course,

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.430
you confined vector ones as well that you can add on top so you can scale up that crunch

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.510
texture nicely.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.580
We're going to use this just to kind of see how the client likes it.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.350
So let's start with this lighter color one.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.860
We're gonna go ahead and make sure that's all group together.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:07.760
We're gonna go ahead,

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.350
overlay our texture on top.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.230
We're gonna make sure the texture is on the top and we're gonna go over and add a layer

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.850
mask.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.910
And then we're to see if we can't click back on this original one and make it a darker

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:21.500
color.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.030
Gonna see the greediness a little bit more and let's move this around a bit.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.050
Let's go and select this.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.860
Go back to our layering mask and move this around.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.450
I go over this in more detail in the introductory lessons of this course,

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.680
and I'm just trying to find what I think would be the right kind of greediness.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.950
So there's a little grittiness right there on that one.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.310
We can emulate the same thing on the the reversed one.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:56.110
So all we have to do is kind of copy and paste this and copy a little bigger.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.600
There's kind of our little greediness involved with those.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.930
We could do that similar to weaken use other textures.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.030
Other could even make your own gritty texture as we did in that lesson.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.870
Um,

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.410
and we can kind of start to apply it to all of these.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.320
It's gonna be the same method for this next one we're gonna make want to make this all

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.950
darker.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.920
So let me go ahead and create outlines here on the type and make this all kind of a dark

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.410
black.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.250
I think the textural show up a little bit better there,

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.580
and we're just gonna select both and we're gonna make a mask.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.450
Were to select the masked area.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.480
You have a ship this around until we have a presentation we like.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.570
So just added that little bit of pop of texture that I think the client is looking for.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.300
And I'm gonna do the same thing with this other idea is going to do the same thing,

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.510
adding that that that bit of texture,

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.280
I could probably even just add it here on that outside part.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.550
So let me go ahead and copy this,

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.050
just paste it,

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.590
and then I could go ahead,

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.450
release that mask that one back,

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:07.150
and let's see if we can't just select this circle area.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.910
That's a little grittiness,

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.350
and we could make this circle a bit deeper,

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.410
and we might be able to use a different texture for this one.

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.670
There's a lot in that downloadable resource.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.820
There's several that you can create the vector ones you can find on a lot of this free

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.100
vector websites type in vector grunge graphics.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.950
You'll be able to kind of find that effect.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.740
So we're adding a little bit of that grunge effect of some of them just to kind of showing

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:34.620
what that looks like.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.890
We also want to be able to start to add color.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.070
So we're gonna really think about color.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.250
It's gonna be a little bit easy,

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.710
cause these are all very simple logo,

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.570
So colors Probably not gonna be too much of a big deal.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.600
But let's explore color palettes and see how those look on these three different concepts.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.870
And then we can send our second round of revisions with the greediness added,

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.550
which was something the client requested,

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.010
but also with color.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.910
So these were really gonna be a final presentation.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.280
There could be 1/3 round.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.020
It could be 1/4 round of little changes,

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.000
but we're gonna present the logo like we would send the final files.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.300
So we're gonna really have everything perfect.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.460
So we're gonna use grids to kind of make sure everything's perfect in line.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:12.790
We're gonna add the color.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.800
It's gonna be a final presentation of these concepts.
